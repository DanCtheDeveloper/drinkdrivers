Project Name:
    Drink Driver

Group Members:
    Dan Contin, Andre Taqain, Anthony Munoz, Samuel McHargue, Nicolas Nueca, Kyle Donmoyer

Inspiration and Explanation:
    "Drink Driver is an application that allows users to safely order from different Breweries around the user location. Once ordered, the brewery will fulfill the order and it will be delivered to the users location"

Using the App:
    On load, the app will ask user if age is 21+.

    Once age is verified, home screen will show login, about page, vendors, and beer available.

    User can login and create a new profile to order from brewery, then will be redirected back to home page.

    User can then view vendor page, cart, beer available page, and about page.

    *Fun fact...if user is not 21+, they will get a link to a different children's page, PBS Kids*

Technologies Used:
    Technology 1: React for frontend 

    Technology 2: Node.js for backend

    Technology 3: MongoDB for database 

    Technology 4: CSS, and Bootstrap Framework for styling

    Technology 5: Vercel for deployment

Outstanding Bugs and Unfinished Functionality:
    Bug 1: Describe a known issue in the app: Couldn't get the frontend to talk with backend and use Mongo database information 

    Unfinished Functionality: Ordering the beer and checking out is a functionality that is still being worked on.

Additional Sources: 
    Page outline was built using Figma

    Github Projects helped with keeping tasks set to one person unless help was needed

    Canva AI was used to create background, cart and settings images, logos for breweries, and main Drink Driver logo

    Google was heavily used to find sources to help with creating databases, deploying, and frameworks for styling.
